clear 
close all

% set up TCP IP connection for Server

% get information about size of data that will be arriving

    % needs GUI control
    % create mat file where data is stored later
    % set data size for receiving data --> adjust buffer
    % While streaming = 1 
        % while loop
        %--> receive one package in DataSize that was
            % adjusted before: Data size = channel*fsample*time
        % store variable in the matlab file that was created before
        % increase amount of packs to store at the right place
        % break if try is used 
        % tell whether receiving was successful
    % pause at the end of data streaming of 0.01 seconds
% close connection if first while loop is not active, so when stop button
% is pressed 
        
    % new data always needs to be added columnwise because of fread
