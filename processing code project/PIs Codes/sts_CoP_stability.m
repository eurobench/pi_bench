%
% PI3: STS CoP stability – this PI consists of a 2 elements array of scalars 
% indicating the average distance travelled by the CoP both in AP and ML directions. 
% Distance data are averaged across the 5 STS cycles. 
% Data from both the Chair and lower limb kinematics are needed for calculating this PI.
